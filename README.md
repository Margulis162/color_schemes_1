Project Description:

This project is my very first attempt at web development. It was partially inspired by a book I was reading at the time, "The Principles of Beautiful Web Design" (third edition) by Jason Beaird & James George. During the development process, I had the opportunity to familiarize myself with Bootstrap, JS, and SASS, as well as some basic design concepts such as layout, typography, and color schemes.

Features:

Bootstrap: for layout and responsiveness.
    JavaScript (JS): for responsiveness.
    SASS: for the creation of easier maintenance of CSS.


Design & Inspiration:

The outdated web design book served as a partial inspiration for this project. I applied certain design elements and concepts from the book, which influenced the project's overall look and feel.

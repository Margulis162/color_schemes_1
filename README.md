COLOR SCHEMES

This project is my very first attempt at web development. It was partially inspired by an outdated book on web design that I was reading at the time. During the development process, I had the opportunity to familiarize myself with Bootstrap, JS, and SASS, as well as some basic design concepts such as layout, typography, and color schemes.

FEATURES

Bootstrap: layout and responsivness.
JavaScript (JS): responsivnes.
SASS: for creation of easier maintence of CSS.
 

DESIGN & INSPIRATION
